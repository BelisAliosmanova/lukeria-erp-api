Project Summary for Lukeria Ltd.
Within the scope of the Lukeria Ltd. project, we are working on developing a software system that aims to help the company track inventory of materials, monitor inventory of finished products, and automatically generate invoices and other documents for specific orders.

The main functionalities of the system include:

Management of material inventory: The system allows the company to track and control the availability of materials required for production. This involves recording incoming and outgoing materials, updating inventory levels, and generating relevant reports and notifications when necessary.

Management of finished product inventory: The system provides the ability to trace and control the inventory of finished products in the company's warehouses. This includes recording incoming and outgoing products, updating inventory levels, and generating inventory and order fulfillment reports.

Automatic generation of invoices and documents: The system facilitates the automatic generation of invoices and other necessary documents related to purchased or sold products. This includes generating invoices for orders, generating delivery notes, acceptance certificates, and other relevant documents.

The project aims to provide Lukeria Ltd. with an efficient and convenient tool for managing inventory and generating the necessary documents, thereby improving the efficiency and transparency of the company's business processes.
